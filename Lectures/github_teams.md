# Working as a Team in GitHub

<!---
+ Introduce Teams

* Identify one team member as the first to join the assignment.  Upon visiting
the GitHub Classroom site, this team member will need to create a new team
using the given team name.  This action will create a new team repository.      
* Other team members can now visit the GitHub Classroom site, and join the
already existing team.
--->

* Use `.gitignore` file in your team repository.
  + Prevents you from pushing up your virtual environment or other settings 
    files which bloats 
    repositories and can break the set-up of others who clone your repo.
  + You can create a template version of `.gitignore` in GitHub:
    - Click "Add File" and select "Create new file"
    - Enter `.gitignore` as file name.  A new dropdown box will display in
      upper right portion of window in which you can select "Python".
    - Commit the file and make sure to pull it to your local repository.
    - Add any uniquely named virtual environments, `.idea`, or other things
      not already in the template.
  + Note: a default license file can be added in the same way.  Just enter
    "license.txt" or "license.md" as the file name.
      
+ Use GitHub Issues and Milestones to plan your work.
  + Milestones represent big picture items.  Examples:  
    + Create webserver
    + Setup Database
    + Design GUI
  + Create issues and assign them to each milestone that describe how to 
    implement each milestone
  + Can use these milestones and issues as a roadmap for getting work done.
  + Make sure to add an assignee to each issue to make sure someone is
    responsible for making sure it happens.
    
* Avoid direct commits to `main` branch
  + Solving conflicts
    - [Description of how to solve conflicts](../Resources/Git/MergeConflicts.md)
  
+ All questions about project should be directed through Issues
  + Make sure to add recipient as assignee or tag them.
  + Link to code with issue
  + For errors, link to a unit test or code that can be run to generate the
    error, or link to GitHub Actions report
  
## Final Project Planning
##### Patient Lab Test Results Server Assignment Lookback
* Each team member should complete the following template:

|               | What went well | What could go better | What to do different |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Planning      |                |                      |                      |
| Communication |                |                      |                      |
| Execution     |                |                      |                      |
* Share this with me and your teammates via e-mail
  
##### Work Plan for Final Project
* As a team, develop milestones and issues for completing the project.
* Assign a team member (and optional due date) to each issue.  Remember that
  each team member should be assigned to one of the GUIs.
* Communicate to me when your plan is complete so I may review it. 
  
__Please target completion of your lookback and issues/milestones, and 
share them with me, by the end of day Friday, April 7.__  
* I will be looking to see how you use Milestones/Issues for communication
in my grading of the final project.
