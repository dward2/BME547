# Testing Workflow and Continuous Integration
How should unit testing be integrated into the development work flow?  It could
be run manually by the developer whenever they think to do it.  Ideally, it 
would be done each time a change is made.  And, the tests would be run not just
on the new code, but on all of the existing code to make sure that the new
changes didn't break anything.

So, a good practice is to automate the running of the tests and for this 
automatic running of tests to be done whenever changes are made to the code 
base.

The tests should be designed so they ensure that the code runs and performs as 
expected.  Then, when developers add new code to the repository, the existing 
tests can be used to ensure that the code that is added meets the desired 
specifications and works correctly.  This increases confidence that frequent 
code changes can be made while maintaining code quality.  Finally, by having 
the tests automated, you ensure that everyone tests their code, and doesn't 
"forget".  These considerations are especially important when you are 
collaborating on a code base.    

This approach of frequent code updates and testing is called Continuous 
Integration and Testing can be integrated with the use of GitHub.  GitHub
Actions provides the ability to automate certain tasks.  We can automate the
running of our tests everytime new code is pushed into a branch in 
GitHub and/or when a pull request is made.  By ensuring that these automated
tests pass before doing amy merges, we can make sure code added to the main
branch has been tested and met quality control.

## Using GitHub Actions
### Create a testing action
Let's assume you have a repository in which you have created a virtual 
environment and have a python module and python test module as such:
```
repository
├──venv/
├──my_program.py
└──test_my_program.py
```
1. Create a folder in your repository called `.github`.  Within this folder,
   create a subfolder called `workflows`.
2. In the `workflows` folder, create a file with the extension `.yml`.  You can 
   name this file anything, but I might suggest `pytest_runner.yml`.  The 
   repository should now look like this:
   ```
   repository
   ├──.github/
   │  └──workflows/
   │     └──pytest_runner.yml
   ├──venv/
   ├──my_program.py
   └──test_my_program.py
   ```
3. Add the following content to the `pytest_runner.yml` file (or whatever name
   you choose in step 2):
    ```yaml
    name: Pytest with Pycodestyle
    
    on: [push, pull_request]
    
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Set up Python 3.10
          uses: actions/setup-python@v2
          with:
            python-version: '3.10'
        - name: Install dependencies
          run:  pip install -r requirements.txt
        - name: Test with pytest
          run:
            pytest -v --pycodestyle
    
    ```
   A brief description of the file above:
   * `name` on the first line is the name of the GitHub action you are creating 
     and will be shown on the GitHub website.  Can be anything.  The use of `name` 
     under the `steps` title simply provides a string to include in the run output
     describing what each step does.  Can be anything.
     * `on` indicates what repository actions will trigger this action.  In the 
above example, `push` means that any push of commits to GitHub will trigger
this action while `pull_request` means that the creation of a pull request
will trigger the action.  If you only want to run it on pull requests, simply
remove `push` from the list
     * `runs-on` indicates the type of virtual machine that will be used for this
testing.  Please keep this as `ubuntu-latest`.
     * `uses` defines the actions to take to set up a virtual environment
       + `actions/checkout@v2` calls a standard action that checks out or clones
         your repo to the virtual machine
       + `actions/set-up python@v2` calls a standard action to set up a Python
         operating environment on the virtual machine
         - `with:`
           `python-version` indicates the specific Python version to be used.
           Change the 3.10 to a different version if needed.
     * `run` gives the specific commands to run in the virtual environment
       + `pip install -r requirements.txt`
       + `pytest -v --pycodestyle`
  
   The above configuration file can be used as is.
4. Return to the main folder of the repository.  Enter the command 
   `git status`.  Use the `git add` and `git commit` commands to commit the
   folders and files created for GitHub Actions.
5. Push the branch to GitHub.  GitHub Actions should now be active on GitHub.
  

### conda users
While you use `conda` for creating virtual environments on your local computer,
the GitHub action described above uses `pip` for package installation in its 
virtual environments.  So, even though you will not use a `requirements.txt` 
file locally, you will need to create one for use in your repository so 
the GitHub action can create the 
proper virtual environment.  


### Command line entries to implement the above
Here are typical command line entries to complete the steps above.  Note, this
assumes that you start in the main folder of the repository and are 
currently on the `main` branch.  Also, these are generic commands and may need
to be different based on your situation.

```bash
git branch ci_setup
git checkout ci_setup
mkdir .github
cd .github
mkdir workflows
cd workflows
touch pytest_runner.yml
```
Now, populate the `pytest_runner.yml` file with information as described
above.
```bash
cd ..
cd ..
git status
git add .github
git commit -m "Activate GitHub Actions"
git push 
```
## Recommended Workflows for Setting up GitHub Actions and other repository items
There are two recommended methods for how to integrate the set-up of GitHub
Actions and other initial repository items into the feature branch workflow.
They are to either i) use a "set-up" branch or, ii) integrate these actions 
into your first true feature branch.

### Using a set-up branch
1.  Immediately after cloning your repository, create a branch with a name such 
as `setup` or `repo_initialization`.  
2. As described above, create the GitHub Actions `.yml` file in the appropriate 
place.  Add and commit that file to the repository.  
3. Create the `requirements.txt` file that will be needed by GitHub Actions to 
create the virtual environment.  At a minimum, include `pytest` and 
`pytest-pycodestyle`.  Add and commit that file to the repository.
4. Create a Python code file so that `pytest` will have something to find and
check.  If there are not any `*.py` files, `pytest` will give an error causing
GitHub Actions to fail.  I would recommend creating the file you plan in which
you plan to write your code.  Then, include the single command `pass` in the
file.  Add and commit this file to the repository.
5. Add any other initial files you would like to include, such as `.gitignore`.
6. Push this branch to GitHub.
7. On GitHub, open a pull request to merge this branch into `main`.  When the
GitHub Actions shows passing status, merge the branch.
8. In your local repository, checkout the `main` branch and pull in the merged
changes from GitHub.

### Integrating set-up with first feature branch
1. Immediately after cloning your repository, create your first feature branch.
2. Follow steps 2 through 5 under "Using a set-up branch" above.
3. Start writing the code for your first feature.
4. Ensure you write any needed unit tests for the code written on this branch.
5. Push the branch to GitHub.
6. On GitHub, open a pull request to merge this branch into `main`.  When the
GitHub Actions shows passing status, merge the branch.
7. In your local repository, checkout the `main` branch and pull in the merged
changes from GitHub.
