# Programming Assessment

This assessment is designed to help evaluate your initial understanding of basic
programming concepts.  The specifics or "correctness" of your response will not
be graded as this assessment is meant as a diagnostic to understand your current
level of knowledge.  However, the completion of this assessment will be part of
your participation grade.

Difficulty in completing some parts of this assessment will help indicate 
areas for additional study so that you are prepared for the
other assignments in this course.

Complete the following exercises in the programming language of your choice.
Upload the source code file(s) to the appropriate Canvas assignment.  Include
any comments you would like to share as comments within your code file.

If you cannot complete any part of this assignment, that is okay and simply
indicates an area for some additional learning so you can be successful in the
rest of the course.  Make a note in your uploaded code file about the part of 
the assignment you could not complete.

## Exercise One
* Create a variable that contains an array or list that contains the following 
  strings:
  + apple
  + banana
  + cranberry
  + date
  + eggplant
  + fennel
  + guava
* You can read in the words above from a data file or manually hard-code them
  into your variable.
* Write code that will parse the data in the variable above and create two new 
  variables, each of which contains a new array or list.  One of these new
  variables should contain all the strings from the array above with five 
  characters or less.  The second new variable should contain all the strings 
  with six characters or more.
* For each of the two new variables, write code that will output each string,
  on its own line, to either the screen or an output file.
  
## Exercise Two
* Write a function that receives a number as a parameter and returns a boolean
  of `true` if the parameter is positive and returns `false` if not.
* Write a function that accepts three parameters (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and
  returns the two solutions to the quadratic formula.  You can ignore complex
  numbers for this assignment and assume that the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`
  will always yield two real roots.
* Write a program that 
  + accepts three inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` as either input from the keyboard, 
    read-in from a file, or entered directly into the code as variables,
  + uses the two functions developed above to determine whether the roots of 
    the quadratic equation based on the three inputted parameters 
    are of the same sign (i.e., both positive or negative), and
  + outputs the answer (same sign or different sign) to either the screen or
    a file.
