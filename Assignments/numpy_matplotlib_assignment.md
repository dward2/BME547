# NumPy and Matplotlib Exercise

You will receive an invitation via e-mail to a GitHub private repository in the
BME547-Spring2025 organization. Accept the invitation and then clone that
repository to your local computer.

In that repository, please read the README.md file that contains specific
instructions for completing the assignment.

When finished, make sure to save and commit all changes made to any Jupyter
notebooks. Similarly, any new code or data files should be saved and committed
to the repository. Then, push all changes back to GitHub.

This assignment is considered part of the class participation grade. If you
have any questions, please let me know.
