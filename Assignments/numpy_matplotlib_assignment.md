# NumPy and Matplotlib Exercise
In Canvas, there is a "NumPy and Matplotlib Exercise" assignment.  In that
assignment, you will find a link to a GitHub Classroom assignment.  Click on
that link to accept the assignment.  The repository that is created contains
two Jupyter notebooks.

1. Clone this repository to your local computer.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment with the packages found in the 
`requirements.txt` file.
3. Enter `jupyter notebook` which will open a web browser with the Jupyter
interface.
4. Complete the `numpy_demo.ipynb` notebook.  In addition to executing the 
existing cells to see how things work, remember to complete the five **Tasks**.
5. Complete the `matplotlib_demo.ipynb` notebook.  This does not have any tasks,
but still requires you to execute the cells to see how it works.  Feel free
to modify the existing cells or create new ones to make additional plots.
6. Create a Python module with code to complete the following:  
  * Generate a numpy array `time` that contains linear values from 0 to 10 
  with a 0.1 interval between each value.
  * Generate a numpy array `y` that contains a sine wave with a frequency of
  2 over the `time` array
  * Generate a numpy array `z` that contains a sine wave with a frequency of
  0.5 over the `time` array
  * Plot these two sine waves vs. `time`
  * Add the two sine waves to create a new numpy array `s`.
  * Plot `s` vs `time`.

When finished with the above, commit the  new module and the two completed 
Jupyter notebooks to your local repository and push them back to GitHub.

This assignment is considered part of the class participation grade and will
not be graded as a formal assignment.  If you have any questions, please let
me know.
