# Assignment 2:  Git Fundamentals / Practice

In this assignment, you will use some basic `git` commands to add information
to a repository using feature branches.

This assignment will be completed using GitHub Classroom. The Sakai 
announcement for this assignment will contain a URL that will allow you to 
access the assignment. 

Log into your GitHub account.  Then, visit the URL in the Sakai assignment.

Follow the instructions and a private repository containing the name of the 
assignment and your GitHub ID will be created within the BME-547-Spring-2023 
organization.  You will have ongoing access to this repository through your 
personal GitHub account.  To access the repository, click on the GitHub
icon in the upper left portion of the GitHub page that will take you to a 
dashboard page for your account.  You should be able to see your repositories
on the left hand side.  Alternatively, you can click on your GitHub avatar
on the upper right portion of the GitHub page.  Choose "Your Organizations"
from the menu.  Then, pick the "BME-547-Spring-2023" organization on the
Organizations page.  You will then see your repositories within this
organization.  

The repository for this assignment will have an initial README.md 
document containing the instructions for the assignment.   

Your final submission must be committed and pushed to your GitHub Classroom 
repository before the deadline outlined in Sakai.
