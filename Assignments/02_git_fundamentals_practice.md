# Assignment 2:  Git Fundamentals / Practice

In this assignment, you will use some basic `git` commands to add information
to a repository using feature branches.

This assignment will be completed using a GitHub private repository in the 
BME547-Spring2026 GitHub organization.  Look for a GitHub invitation in 
your email to join this repository.

You will have ongoing access to this repository through your 
personal GitHub account.  To access the repository, click on the GitHub
icon in the upper left portion of the GitHub page that will take you to a 
dashboard page for your account.  You should be able to see your repositories
on the left hand side.  Alternatively, you can click on your GitHub avatar
on the upper right portion of the GitHub page.  Choose "Your Organizations"
from the menu.  Then, pick the "BME547-Spring2026" organization on the
Organizations page.  You will then see your repositories within this
organization.  

The repository for this assignment will have an initial README.md 
document containing the instructions for the assignment.   

Your final submission must be committed and pushed to this GitHub private 
repository before the deadline outlined in Canvas.
