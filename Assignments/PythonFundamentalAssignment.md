# Python Fundamental Assignment

This assignment will be done using Jupyter notebooks.

In the Canvas assignment, you will see a link to a GitHub Classroom.  Log into 
your GitHub account and then visit that site.  This will create a repository 
specific for you.  Clone this repository onto your local computer, and then
navigate to the folder containing the repository.

Next, you need to create a virtual environment that has `jupyter` installed
in it.  You may use an existing environment (such as the one created in class)
that already has `jupyter` installed, or you can create a new one for this
assignment.  

Do not commit your virtual environment folder to the repository.  Instead, 
create a `.gitignore` file and add the folder name of your virtual environment 
to this file.  Save and commit the `.gitignore` file to the repository.  

Activate your virtual environment and install the `jupyter` package in this 
virtual environment.

The initial repository will contain a Jupyter notebook in which you will
complete the assignment.  To open the Jupyter notebook, type:

```
jupyter notebook PythonFundamentals.ipynb
```
A web browser will automatically launch, or you will be instructed to open a
browser and open address `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`.  This browser window
will contain the Jupyter Notebook for you to use.

Work through the interactive notebook.  Execute existing code cells.  Make sure
to complete the TASKS that are indicated.  Make sure to save the notebook when 
you are finished.  Then, in `git`, add and commit the completed Jupyter 
Notebook file and then push the commit up to GitHub.  (*Note*: For this 
assignment, it is okay to make a commit on the `main` branch.)  Visit the 
GitHub Classroom repository to ensure that your completed notebook is, in fact, 
uploaded.  We will be grading the file that is found in your GitHub Classroom 
site.

The deadline for this assignment can be found in Canvas.
