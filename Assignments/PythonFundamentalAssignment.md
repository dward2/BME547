# Python Fundamental Assignment

This assignment will be done using Jupyter notebooks.

In the Sakai assignment, you will see a link to a GitHub Classroom.  Log into 
your GitHub account and then visit that site.  This will create a repository 
specific for you.  Clone this repository onto your local computer, and then
navigate to the folder containing the repository.

Next, create a virtual environment in the folder containing your repository.  
Do not commit these files to the repository.  Instead, create a 
`.gitignore` file and add the folder name of your virtual environment to this 
file.  Save and commit the file.  

Activate your virtual environment and install the `jupyter` package in this 
virtual environment.

The initial repository will contain a Jupyter notebook in which you will
complete the assignment.  To open the Jupyter notebook, type:

```
jupyter notebook PythonFundamentals.ipynb
```
A web browser will automatically launch, or you will be instructed to open a
browser and open address `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`.  This browser window
will contain the Jupyter Notebook for you to use.

Work through the interactive notebook.  Make sure to save it when you are
complete.  Then, in `git`, add and commit the completed Jupyter Notebook file
and then push the commit up to GitHub.  Visit the GitHub Classroom repository
to ensure that your completed notebook is, in fact, uploaded.  We will be 
grading the file that is found in your GitHub Classroom site.

The deadline for this assignment can be found in Sakai.
