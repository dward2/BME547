# GUI Assignment

In this assignment, you will write Python code that creates a graphical user
interface (GUI) to implement a task of your choosing.

## Choosing/Designing a Project

Information on two suggested projects are provided
at [Resources/GUI_Projects](../Resources/GUI_Projects). Those suggested
projects are:

* **Blackjack**: Create a GUI to implement a simple game of Blackjack. Helper
  code is provided to implement the game in terms of cards, dealing cars,
  calculating score, etc. You need to implement the basic game play through the
  GUI.
* **Medial Image Annotation**:  Create a GUI to display and add text to medical
  images. Helper code is provided for displaying images on a GUI and adding
  text to the image. You need to implement the GUI to allow for the user to
  input their choices for text, font size/color, text location, etc.

Alternatively, you are welcome to come up with a GUI project that meets your
interest. It could be implementing some other game, completing some
task, etc. At a minimum, the GUI needs the following:

* At least one label
* At least one entry box (entered text must be used somehow by the code)
* At least one radio button, checkbox, or dropdown box (the values of these
  items must be used somehow by the code)
* At least two buttons
    * One button needs to be connected to a function that takes the input from
      the GUI, does some task, and updates the GUI in response.
    * One button should close the window and stop the program.

Of course, your GUI can have more than the minimum above as desired and needed
by your project.

If you would like to ensure that your idea meets the minimum requirements,
please contact the instructor.

## Evaluation

You will receive an invitation to a repository in the BME547-Spring2025
organization. Please use this repository to implement your code. If you choose
one of the suggested projects, make sure to download the provided files and add
them to your repository.

This assignment will be evaluated on the following criteria:

* Good feature branch git workflow usage, including meaningful commit messages
* GUI functionality
* PEP-8 style compliance
* Good code modularity in terms of functions
* README content, that includes:
    * Your name
    * the name of your project
    * a user's guide with detailed instructions on how to use the GUI. This
      user's guide should include visuals/pictures of your interface
* Presence of a license

For this assignment alone, you are not required to:

* Create docstrings
* Create unit tests
* Integrate GitHub Actions

Feel free to include these non-required items if it helps in your development.
