# PyCharm (IDE)

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a professional-caliber
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that combines many of the tools that
we have been individually using to date, including
* Virtual environment utilization
* Syntax highlighting
* PEP8 linting
* Docstring auto-generation
* Syntax checking
* Unit test running
* Debugging
* Interactive python console and terminal
* git version control

For educational purposes, you can download the full-featured professional
version of the program using your `.duke.edu` email address: https://www.jetbrains.com/student/

You do not *have* to use PyCharm, as many other code editors provide similar
functionality, but we will use it as an example platform.
