# Coverage

Coverage refers to the amount of code that is "covered" by your test cases. If code is fully covered, it means that tests have been written in a way such that every line of code has been executed at least once. This makes coverage a powerful tool for determining how sufficient your battery of tests is. 

## Installation

You can generate coverage reports using the [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html) package (Note: pytest-cov is a wrapper around the more general [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.6.1/) package, but for the purposes of this class we'll just be looking at pytest-cov since we already use pytest). This can be installed in your current environment using `pip install pytest-cov` or `conda install -c conda-forge pytest-cov`.

## Usage

Pytest-cov is a plugin for pytest, just like  pytest-pycodestyle, so we use it very similarly. To run your tests with coverage, you can use the command `pytest --cov=<path_to_directory_with_tests>` in the terminal. Since our tests are usually in the main repository folder where we are running our terminal (e.g. our terminal is running out of "C:<user_path>\bme547_repos\bme-547-classwork-zspald", which is the same directory our tests are in), so the path can be omitted, shortening the command to `pytest --cov`.

Running `pytest --cov` executes your tests and produces a brief coverage report in the command line. This tells you how many lines/statements you have, how many of those statements were executed by your tests, and the percentage of your code that is covered by your tests (the number of total lines minus the number of missed lines divided by the total number of lines).

This is a good start, but it doesn't help us in fixing the lines that are not covered. Adding an additional argument helps this. If we instead run `pytest --cov --cov-report term-missing`, we get a more detailed report that shows us which lines were not covered by our tests. This is useful for identifying which parts of your code are not being tested, and can help you write more tests to cover these areas.

The coverage arguments can be added to the usual pytest arguments we run, so a command that runs tests, coverage, and pycodestyle would look like `pytest -v --pycodestyle --cov --cov-report term-missing`.

## Visualizing Coverage Reports (HTML)

The report above is still a bit tedious to fix uncovered code, as you have to find the line numbers reported in the command line, find them in your code, write some tests, and then repeat for the uncovered lines. Pytest-cov also offers a better method of visualization to make this process easier. We can modify the type of coverage report generated. Running `pytest --cov --cov-report html` will generate an HTML report for all python files run by the tests. This report can be found in the `htmlcov` directory that is created in the same directory as the tests. Opening the `index.html` file in this directory will show you a more detailed report of your coverage. HTML reports will need to be opened in a browser or other viewer capable of rendering HTML files (VSCode can render HTML files if you right click and select "Show Preview").

Clicking on one of the linked files in the report will show you the lines of the file, with green highlighting on covered lines and red highlighting on uncovered lines, making it easier to view uncovered code quickly. For example, in my Patient class below, my tests never cover the case where I provide an invalid index in my function that would raise an error, so I should go write a test to cover that case.

In another file called `heartrate_analysis.py`, I have more uncovered code (see below). However, it's fine for some of these functions to be uncovered, as we don't write tests for every function. Specifically, you don't need the code that loads data, displays output, or runs the main driver function to be covered by tests as we have discussed in class. However, we can see there is an uncovered line in a testable function. So I do need to write a test for that.

## Visualizing Coverage Reports (VSCode)

Extensions in VSCode also make it easy to view your coverage without having to open HTML files. There may be multiple ways to do this, but the way I do this is through the extension "Covereage Gutters".

![cov_gutter.png](images/cov_gutter.png)

If you have this extension installed, you can view similar information to the HTML report directly in your code editory, displayed as green or red highlight in the "gutters" to the left of the line numbers. This extension read coverage information from an XML file, so you will have to run the command `pytest --cov --cov-report xml`. Then, you can press the "Watch" button on the bottom bar of VSCode (see below highlighted in red, next to Git information) to load enable coverage gutters via the extension.

![vscode_cov_pre.png](images/vscode_cov_pre.png)

After pressing the "Watch" button, you will see the coverage information displayed in the gutters of your code editor and the percentage of coverage for the current file replacing the "Watch" button. Click this percentage of coverage (see below highlighted in red, where the watch button was previously) to turn off the coverage gutters. **Note: This information does not update in real-time. Gutters will only change after generating a new XML report.**

*Note: Due to the location of the coverage gutters where breakpoints are set for debugging, you will need to disable to coverage gutters to replace breakpoints*

## 100% Coverage DOES NOT Mean Perfect Tests

Just because all of your code is covered by your tests, it does not mean that all of your testing is done. Testing is an art, and you need to use some creativity and thinking from the user perspective to determine all scenarios that need testing so that your software runs well. For example, in one of the methods of my patient class below, the function is covered by tests, but assumes a fixed length of heart rate data coming in. This code will either throw an index error if a list of shorter length is processed, or will not process data after the fixed point, which is a glaring flaw in my code. I would know this is happening by creating tests with different lengths of heartrate data, but I still achieve 100% coverage without such tests. Don't let coverage be your only metric for sufficient testing!
